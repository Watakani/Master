\begin{definition}\label{def:neuralnet_kidger_def}
    Let \(\mathcal{NN}^{\phi}_{K}\) be a fully connected neural network where
    each hidden layer have \(K\) nodes, and with activation function \(\phi\colon \R \to \R\)
    that is continuous, nonaffine, and include at least one point that is continuously differentiable
    with nonzero derivative.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[\cite{nn_uni}]\label{thm:uni_nn}
    Let \(\mathcal{X}\subset \R^D\) be compact and \(\mathcal{NN}_{D+M+2}^{\phi}\)
    have input size \(D\) and output size \(M\).
    Then, if the network \(\mathcal{NN}_{D+M+2}^{\phi}\) allows for 
    arbitrary depth, is dense in \(C(\mathcal{X}; \R^M)\).
\end{theorem}
